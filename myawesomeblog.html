      Mermaids are the best because they live in the oceans and have beautiful singing voices and hair.

    <header>Mermaids are dangerous</header>
    <section>
      Because they are incredibly beautiful, people do not suspect that they may be dangerous. In many legends they use their voices to lure men to their deaths on the rocky shores. ( but if you ask me they shouldn't be trying to get all up on those mermaids. They're just singing and swimming, they didn't ask for the attention.)

      The  should be left to their ways. Though I have always aspired to be one, I would never dream of interupting their way of life. I will just continue to wish and look into anamatronic tails that increase swimm speed by up to 80% (yes they exist and are just as awesome as they sound.)
